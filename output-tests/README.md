These tests are intended to validate that implementations are correctly generating output in accordance with the specification.

Output was initially specified with draft 2019-09.  It remained unchanged for draft 2020-12, but will receive an update with the next release.

***NOTE** Although the formats didn't change between 2019-09 and 2020-12, the tests are replicated for 2020-12 because the `$schema` is different and implementations may (but shouldn't) produce different output.*

## Organization

The tests are organized by specification release and then into two categories: content and structure.

Content tests verify that the keywords are producing the correct annotations and/or error messages.  Since there are no requirements on the content of error messages, there's not much that can be verified for them, but it is possible to identify when a error message _could_ be present.  Primarily, these tests need to extensively cover the annotation behaviors of each keyword.  The only output format needed for these tests is `basic`.

Structure tests verify that the structures of the various formats (i.e. `flag`, `basic`, `detailed`, `verbose`) are correct.  These tests don't need to cover each keyword; rather they need to sufficiently cover the various aspects of building the output structures by using whatever keywords are necessary to do so.

## Test Files

The content of a test file is the same as the validation tests in `tests/`, however an `output` property has been added to each test case.

The `output` property itself has a property for each of the output formats where the value is a schema that will successfully validate for compliant output.  For the content tests, only `basic` needs to be present.

## Contributing

Of course, first and foremost, follow the [Contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

When writing test cases, try to keep output validation schemas targeted to verify a single requirement.  Where possible (and where it makes sense), create multiple tests to cover multiple requirements.  This will help keep the output validation schemas small and increase readability.  (It also increases your test count. ðŸ˜‰)

For the content tests, there is also a _general.json_ file that contains tests that do not necessarily pertain to any single keyword.
<!-- This general.json file may be added to the structure tests later, but I haven't gotten to them yet, so I don't know. -->
